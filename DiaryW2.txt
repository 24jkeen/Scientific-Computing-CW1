Constructing the cheb generator

Copied the matlab code across
Had a go at 'translating it' had issues with resizing and some incompatible functions
approached it step by step :

made code that would generate x, then c, then X, then dX, then D

added the docstring / comments
ran the tests and passed first try

tested a couple examples in Matlab
Method:

- compute D and x using cheb()
- e.g. D * sin(x) ~~ cos(x)
- exp(x)
- D * exp(x) ~~ exp(x)

Tests in Python time

wrote tests to check our method agains some known derivatives 
added a further test to include periodic 

with low margin for error at 0.01 for the direct checks and 0.001 for the periodicity
